Dear Parents, 

  

The Ministry of Education (MOE) introduced the Edusave Character Award (ECHA) in 2012 to **enable schools to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions.** This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore as we broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded. The award also supports our efforts in nurturing students of good values and character, who are active contributors and concerned citizens.

  

The objectives of the ECHA are:

  

            (a) To send a clear and strong signal of the importance that MOE places on character and values, on par with achievements in the academic domain; and

  

            (b) To recognise outstanding students in each school who are exemplary in character, and who can be role models to inspire others.

Eligibility Criteria
--------------------

The nominated students must:   

  

1. **be a Singapore citizen**

2. have demonstrated good character and values in a **consistent manner**. Students may be identified for the following qualities:

  

            (a) Qualities associated with our school values (Love Sincerely, Live Responsibly, Learn Continuously, Serve Humbly and Strive Resiliently)

  

            (b) Demonstrated a high level of civic responsibility: Students must have demonstrated concerns about issues related to their community or issues faced by others. They could have initiated simple action or played an active role to address these issues and demonstrate commitment to making a difference; and/or

  

            (c) Qualities associated with resilience: Students who have persevered despite facing difficult circumstances (e.g. financial problems, health issues, family issues, peer resistance etc) and have managed to overcome the odds and still do commendably well in academic and non-academic domains. Students may be nominated regardless of their academic results provided that their weak academic results are not due to negative character traits but attributed to difficulties that go beyond the control of the student.
