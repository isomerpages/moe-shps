The Edusave Character Award (ECHA) aims to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviours and actions; and who can be role models to inspire others. The Award supports the school's efforts in nurturing students of good values and character, who are active contributors and concerned citizens.

  

### Eligibility Criteria
