### Parent-School Communication

• Parents are encouraged to use the student handbook as a means of communication with the teachers.

• Parents are advised to update the school promptly when there is a change in their contact details or child’s personal particulars either through the Form Teacher or through the school generic email address.

  

### In the event of an emergency:

• In the event of an emergency, parent/guardian will be contacted immediately. For students who are unwell, parent/guardian or an authorised adult should come to the school at the earliest possible time to fetch the child home or to the doctor. He/she must sign the child out at the General Office before taking the child out of the school.

• In the event of an accident that requires immediate attention, the school will contact the parent/guardian. Depending on the urgency for medical attention, the school might send the pupil to the Accident & Emergency Department of Changi General Hospital, to a nearby clinic, or call for an ambulance, while waiting for the parent’s or guardian’s arrival.

  

### Leaving school early

Parent/Guardian must obtain permission from the Form Teacher if they wish to take their child/ward home due to sickness or other urgent matters. Please sign in the ‘Student Early Dismissal’ book at the General Office.

 

  

### Immunisation

Students must be immunised against diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and poliomyelitis before joining the school.
