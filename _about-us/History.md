<p>In 1934, Anglican Archdeacon Graham White acquired Bethel English School
in Ceylon Road to set up an Anglican school for girls. He named it St Hilda’s
School and captured the essence of the school’s aims and inspirations in
the Mosaic command “GO FORWARD” (Exodus 14:15) which has since become the
school motto. The School was officially opened on 08 May.</p>
<p>The school was occupied by the Japanese during the 2nd&nbsp;World War
years. In 1945, St Hilda’s School was the first private school to be reopened
after the War with a staff of 20 and 615 pupils comprising mainly overaged
girls and boys. In 1948, St Hilda’s Afternoon School was started for over-aged
students.</p>
<p>In 1950, the school was accorded Grant-in Aid status by the Colonial government
and it became an all-girls’ school offering both Primary and Secondary
Levels education.</p>
<p>In mid-1980, plans were made for St Hilda’s School to relocate to Tampines
as two schools, a Primary and a Secondary, due to the increasing demand
for better facilities to meet future needs of the students. In 1990, St
Hilda’s Primary School and St Hilda’s Secondary School were officially
opened by the late Dr Tay Eng Soon, then Minister for Education.</p>
