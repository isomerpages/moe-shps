Dear Parents/Guardians, 

In the new school year, we warmly welcome our children back to school as they 'Go Forward' in the fresh year to acquire new skills and knowledge, grow in personhood by being stronger in character and anchored in values. It's going to be another year where they go through a range of learning experiences that shape their young minds and foster strong school spirit, while having the opportunities to demonstrate their care and love for one another, as we see how our Lord Jesus care and love us as His children. 

The theme for this year is **'Making Difference as One**'. The theme verse is Jeremiah 29:7 (ESV) "But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare."

2024 will be a momentous year for the Hildan family as we will be commemorating God's faithfulness over St Hilda's schools. A series of memorable events and activities are lined up for our students so that they appreciate and cherish the long tradition and history of the school, recognise the sacrifices and contributions of our founder and those who came before us, and build the esprit-de-corp that is so alive, among all our students, who had passed through our gates. 

Indeed, it is my privilege to join St Hilda's at this juncture of our school history - a season of time where we witness God's many blessings of achievements, favour and success upon the school. I look forward to the opportunities to work with all our important stakeholders to continue the good work of my predecessors to bring the school to greater heights. But I know I cannot do this by myself except by God's equipping and blessings. Let's continue to remain steadfast in following God's guidance and leading through the year for all our charges, knowing that God will always be our shepherd, provider and protector.
