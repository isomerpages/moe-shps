**_"Building Lives as One"_**

The school theme for 2025 - Building Lives as One - resonates deeply with our mission and vision as a school. Like a wise builder, we recognise that the foundation we lay today is the structure upon which the future will be built. We know that in order to raise resilient, creative, and compassionate individuals, we must be intentional in how we nurture and prepare our students.

Indeed, in this rapidly changing world—one characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, or what we commonly call the VUCA world—our role as educators has never been more critical. We must guide our students to not only navigate these challenges but to thrive in them. And to do so, we must equip them with the skills, values, and adaptability they need to flourish in this dynamic environment.

**Building Strong Foundations**

Just as a builder carefully lays the foundation of a building to ensure its strength and stability, we at St. Hilda’s are committed to laying the best possible foundation for each child, not just in academic achievement, but also the development of character and the nurturing of strong and godly values and future-oriented core skills and competencies.

**Gratitude for Stakeholders’ Support**

The school has many partners and stakeholders whom we are very grateful for their support. Our parents are the pillar of support for our young, entrusting and partnering the school to help moulding the lives of your children. Their belief in the school mission is the cornerstone upon which this school stands.

Our teachers are dedicated, passionate and committed to the holistic development of our students. They are the architects of our students’ futures and tirelessly work to ensure that the foundation we lay as a school is strong and enduring.

Our school community and Hildan family, (our School Management Committee, chaplaincy support from Chapel of Christ the Redeemer, Alumni Association, Parents’ Support Group, St Hilda’s Sec School, coaches, and numerous service providers) contributed their wealth of knowledge, expertise, time and effort to help meet the various and diverse needs of our students, Their unstinting contributions are important building blocks for the school as we grow brick by brick, strength to strength.

**To God be the Glory!**

As the Apostle Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 3:10, _"By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care."_ Indeed, it is by God’s grace that we have been able to lay this strong foundation, and it is through His continued dwelling among us that we are able to build upon it with care and purpose. May we always remain mindful of His divine guidance as we work together to nurture and build the lives of our students for His glory.
