Since the founding of St Hilda’s School by Archdeacon Graham White in 1934, the school has grown and evolved into a dynamic learning community with a vision of developing loyal citizens with global outlook and Godly character.<br>
<br>
We provide a rigorous and forward looking curriculum to challenge every Hildan to excel and be equipped with skills, dispositions and competencies for the 21st century. We believe that students need to be grounded in sound values and be willing to learn continuously to navigate the changing terrains of the future landscape. They need to learn for life.
<br>
<br>	
As we enter the new decade, we are guided by a new vision -  to nurture our students into servant leaders and changemakers of tomorrow. Besides equipping our students with the skills and competencies needed for the demands of a VUCA world, we will inspire our young learners to develop passion in what they do, and purpose to use their skills and talents to serve and make a positive difference in the world around them.
<br>
<br>	
As a community of educators and professionals, the staff at St Hilda’s Primary School strives to provide a caring and stimulating learning environment to bring out the best in every child. Through a plethora of programmes and platforms, we encourage our young learners to discover and develop their interests and talents, grow their social, emotional competencies and serve the community. A firm believer that “it takes a whole village to raise a child”, we forge strong partnerships with parents, alumni, the school management committee, our chaplaincy as well as external organizations and overseas partner schools to realise our vision. <br>
