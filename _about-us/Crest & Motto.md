The School Crest embodies the aims and aspirations of St. Hilda's. Its circular shape symbolises our unity in the midst of the diversity of people, creeds and cultures in Singapore.

  

At the centre of our badge is a Cross mounted on a blue-shield, which represents the teaching of Christ - to be of loving service to our fellow men. The blue colour on the Shield represents a forward movement through waters of uncertainty. The Shield represents our perseverence in our heavenly aspirations grounded on earthly realism through education.

  

The Founder of our School, Archdeacon Graham White captured the essence of the School's aims and aspirations in the Mosaic command,

  

"Go Forward" (Exodus 14:15)
